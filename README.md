# Social Babel
In cyberspace, there's a place called the Feed of Babel. It's filled with random posts and pixelated images. Everything from overshared youth confessions to wild political rants exists there, but good luck finding any of them. Posts are just 140 random characters, lowercase letters, and spaces. Images are 60 by 60 random grayscale pixels. It's a digital maze where coherence is elusive.
